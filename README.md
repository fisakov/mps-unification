Unification
===========

This small package contains a Java implementation of a "near linear" time syntactic unification algorithm.<sup><a href="#uni">1</a></sup>

In order to make use of the API one must implement two interfaces:

    Term
    Var
    
These are used by the algorithm to analyze the syntax graph. 

The results are provided in the form of variable bindings. On successful unification, the algorithm returns the solution in a triangular form.
